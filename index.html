	    <p>Oh, Bash…</p>
	    <br>
	    <p>Now that you’re terminal, I guess I should say all the thing that I wasn’t able to say before.</p>
	    <br>
	    <p>You always seemed so grounded, so aware of where you are, when you use pwd to return the present working directory. </p>
	    <br>
	    <p>You could always speak your mind and list exactly what was going on inside with ls.</p>
	    <br>
	    <p>And better yet, you always knew how to get exactly where you want by typing cd. </p>
	    <br>
	    <p>For example, there was the time you backed up with cd .., the time we went home with cd ~, and who could forget the time we went allll the way back with cd /.</p>
	    <br>
	    <p>I remember just how crafty with your hands. With a light touch, you could make a file. With a gentle mkdir, and entire folder. </p>
